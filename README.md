# Heady
Heady is a small utility and library designed to scan a set of C++ files and generate a single header file from all source files.  This is useful for library developers who wish to offer a single combined library header, but wish to develop the library using a more traditional structure with multiple header and source files.

Heady automatically detects any #include directives in the form ```#include "filename.h"```, in which quotes are used instead of angle brackets <>.  A list of dependencies is created for each source file, all source files are then ordered using this dependency information, and a single header is generated.  No alteration to the original files are made aside from stripping out the ```#include "filename.h"``` directives.  As such, source files must be written in such a matter as to be "header-friendly".

## Requirements
Heady is written in standard C++ 17, and should theoretically be compliant with any compiler and standard library which fully implements this standard.  However, due to a lack of support for <filesystem> on my macOS and Linux machines' standard libraries, I haven't been able to confirm functionality on these OSes.

## Using Heady
Heady is a small utility designed to be integrated as part of a build or post-build process.

    usage:
    Heady options

    where options are:
        -s, --source <source>        folder containing source files
        -e, --excluded <excluded>    exclude specific files
        -o, --output <output>        output filename for generated header file
        -?, -h, --help               display usage information

    Example usage:
    Heady --source "Source" --exluded "Main.cpp clara.hpp" --output "Include\Heady.hpp"

## Heady as a Library
Naturally, the heady library is available as a combined single header file, generated by Heady from its own source.  You can find the merged header file in ```/Include/Heady.hpp```
